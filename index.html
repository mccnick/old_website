      <h2>About Me / Skills</h2>
    
      <p>
        I'm currently a rising Junior at Iowa State University majoring in
        Software Engineering. I have experience with Java, Python, C/C++,
        HTML/CSS/JS. I have experience with backend engineering through my SWE
        Internship @ John Deere and Iowa State coursework. I am also enjoying
        front-end development through self-learning building this website and my
        first app. I eventually want to learn threeJS and make a more
        professional portfolio. I enjoy solving problems, helping people and
        making cool stuff â˜º
      </p>

      <h2 id="experience">Currently Seeking</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently seeking SWE Internships for Spring & Summer 2024! (and
          potentially Fall 2024)
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in GPS/Navigation for any tech company with a Maps
          platform or avionics/satellite application for an aerospace company. I
          am also interested in fintech internships with my previous finance
          industry experience.

      <p>
        I went back to school for engineering in my late twenties after about
        eight years in the finance industry (Wells Fargo, Toyota). My freshman
        year I was still full-time at Wells Fargo
        <a
          href="https://www.registrar.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/info/DeansListF21Updated418.pdf"
          >while</a
        >
        taking full-time Aerospace Engineering classes, this was around the time
        I decided I enjoyed programming and switched my major. My entire
        sophomore year at Iowa State I was a Software Engineering Intern at John
        Deere (20 hrs/wk) working on vehicle software testing and was exposed to
        multiple technologies including Java, C/C++ and GPS/Navigation methods.
        I also helped them manage tractor data using Python and MATLAB.

      <h2>What am I currently working on?</h2>
      <p>
        Building: I am building my first app! I am working on a fairly large solo project
        involving building an app from scratch using React Native and
        Google/Apple Maps API to help Iowa State Students. I don't have an
        urgent timeline for this as I'm very busy with school, but I also want
        to make sure it's the quality I expect of myself before it's released. I
        plan on finishing it within this next year along with unit testing in
        small batches. If you'd like to know more about the app, feel free to
        reach out to me!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Self-Learning:
        I am trying to focus on solving algorithm problems as I know it is an
        important skill to have as a software engineer. I am currently focusing
        on my full-stack development skills. A majority of my early coursework
        at Iowa State involved back-end engineering projects in Java. I am
        actively teaching myself about ReactJS, React Native, Front-End
        Frameworks, UI/UX. In addition, I'm learning on my own about version
        control with Git and GitHub.
