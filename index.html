      <h1>Welcome! I'm Nick McCullough.</h1>
      <p>
        This is my first website and will be using it as my portfolio on GitHub
        Pages.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a rising Junior at Iowa State University majoring in
        Software Engineering. I have experience with Java, Python, C/C++,
        HTML/CSS/JS. I have experience with backend engineering through my SWE
        Internship @ John Deere and Iowa State coursework. I also enjoy
        front-end development through self-learning. I enjoy solving problems,
        helping people and making cool stuff â˜º
      </p>

        Resume
      </a> </h2> 
      <p></p>
      <p class="company-heading">I have worked at these companies:</p>
      <ul class="company-list">
        <li>John Deere</li>
        <li>Wells Fargo</li>
        <li>Toyota</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I went back to school for engineering in my late twenties after about
        eight years in the finance industry (Wells Fargo, Toyota). My freshman
        year I was still full-time at Wells Fargo while taking full-time
        Aerospace Engineering classes, this was around the time I decided I
        enjoyed programming and switched my major. My entire sophomore year at
        Iowa State I was a Software Engineering Intern at John Deere (20 hrs/wk)
        working on vehicle software testing and was exposed to multiple
        technologies including Java/C/C++ and GPS/Navigation methods.
      </p>
      <h2>Currently Seeking</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently seeking SWE Internships for Spring & Summer 2024. I am
        interested in GPS/Navigation for any tech company with a Maps platform
        or avionics/satellite application for an aerospace company. I am also
        interested in fintech internships with my previous finance industry
        experience.
